(In progress) Smart Parking Project using Arduino ESP8266 and Firebase to create a website to show empty parking space so people can easily find empty parking space

Important note: 
- If Esp8266 is not connected to pc, then the data will not be updated
- Sensor in parking slot 1 and 2 is currently broken
- This code works, so don't change anything (I don't want it to be broken/unusable again)
