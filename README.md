Smart Parking Project using Arduino ESP8266 and Firebase to create a website to show empty parking space so people can easily find empty parking space

Important note: 
- As long as my ESP8266 is connected to a power source, the program will keep being updated
- Sensor in parking slot 1 is currently broken
- This code works, so don't change anything (I don't want it to be broken/unusable again)
